Has to experiment with more fixed learning rates.
Also I increased number of iterations (to 10000), because the LR is small. But for 5000 iterations we still get > 90% accuracy.

All the other methods fail:
1/Li -> diverges very quickly (loss rapidly increases)
1/L -> no improvement even after 10000 iterations
ArmijoRule -> Loss function increases, plateau early stopping strikes

In my opinion, the method is unsuccessfull.
I also tried modifying the sampling strategy from: argmax|grad| to argmax|grad|/|Li|. This was another approach explained to us today by the TA. However, no improvement.
